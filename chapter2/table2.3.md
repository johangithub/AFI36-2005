| 1    | is being appointed for the first time                                                                                                                                           |      determine the grade according to [Table 2.1](#table2_1)(see note 2). Compute the TYSD by backdating the date of appointment by the total amount of service credit awarded according to AFI 36-2604, Service Dates and Date of Rank,and this instruction. Determine the DOR by back dating date of appointment by the amount of service credit in excess of the service credit that [Table 2.1](#table2_1) requires to determine the appointment grade. The TFCSD is the date of appointment.              |
| 2    | is a ResAF officer being reappointed (for example, MSC to MC)                                                                                                                   |recompute the TYSD and DOR to reflect any additional service credit authorized according to AFI 36-2604 and this instruction (see note 3). The TFCSD does not change. |
| 3    | is a former RegAF officer who is discharged and accepts appointment in the ResAF in the same competitive category without a break in service                                    |appoint in the grade held when discharged. Compute the TYSD by back dating the date of appointment by the total amount of service credit awarded according to AFI 36-2604 and this instruction. The DOR is the same as the officer's AD DOR (see note 4). The TFCSD is the same as that held on the date of discharge. |
| 4    | is a former AF officer who is discharged and accepts appointment in the ResAF in the same competitive category after a break in service                                         |determine the grade, TYSD, and DOR based on service credit provisions in effect for the Air Force at the time of appointment. When the determination results in a grade that is higher than the previously held grade, appoint in the grade determined based on service credit. When the grade determination results in a grade equal to or lower than the previously held grade, appoint the officer in the previously held grade. Compute the TYSD by backdating the date of the latest appointment by the total amount of service credit awarded according to AFI 36-2604 and this instruction. Add the break in service to the previously held TFCSD and DOR. Add periods of inactive status in the previously held grade to the previously held DOR. |

Determine the DOR by back dating the date of appointment by the amount of service credit in excess of the service credit that [Table 2.1](#table2_1) requires to determine the appointment grade.

| 6    | accepts ResAF appointment in a different competitive category (see note 6)                                                                                                      |Same as Rule 5|

| 8    | is an officer of a Reserve component of another uniformed service (except PHS) and interservice transfers to a Reserve component of the AF in the same competitive category     |appoint in the grade held in the parent service. Compute the TYSD by backdating the date of appointment by the total amount of service credit awarded according to AFI 36-2604 and this instruction. The DOR is the DOR held in the parent service adjusted for any periods of inactive status. The TFCSD is the same as that held in the parent service. The TYSD and DOR must not place the officer beyond mandatory phase points for promotion to the next higher Reserve grade. |

**NOTE:**

1. Age restrictions in [Table 2.1](#table2_1) apply (see paragraph 2.7.4 for exceptions).

2. The total amount of appointment grade credit and DOR credit awarded cannot exceed 14 years except as authorized in paragraph 2.18.2. Also, the awarded DOR may not result in the officer being eligible for promotion consideration within the next 12 months. EXAMPLE:For officers appointed as first lieutenant,the maximum DOR credit is 3 years; as captain, 6 years; as major, 6 years.

3. On reappointment an officer may qualify for the same grade, a higher grade, or a lower grade. Compute the TYSD and DOR in these cases based on service credit provisions in effect for the Air Force at the time of reappointment. Refer to paragraph 3.8 of this instruction for further guidance.

4. If the officer had prior Reserve commissioned service in the same grade not reflected in the DOR, the DOR is adjusted to include prior promotion service in the same grade, excluding inactive service.

5. If the former officer was a physician in another uniformed service, the Principal Deputy Assistant SAF (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, Installations and Environment) (SAF/MI), may approve a request for appointing the officer under rule 4 versus rule 5 as an exception to policy, if justified. Fully justified requests for exception to policy may be forwarded to HQ AFPC/DPAM (for EAD appointments), ANG/MPP (for ANGUS appointments), or HQ USAF/REP, Personnel Division, (USAFR Ready Reserve appointments), for disapproval or recommended approval. If HQ AFPC/DPAM, ANG/MPP, or HQ USAF/REP recommends approval, they forward the request to HQ USAF/DPXF (Force Policy Division) for processing to SAF/MI for a final decision.

6. This rule applies whether or not there is a break in service
