*11. Request for religious accommodation by any pre-accession applicant will not be granted. Instead, applicants will be briefed on the Air Force policy and procedures for seeking religious accommodation once they become members. Specifically, applicants will be briefed that every Airman has the right to request religious accommodation once they have been accessed into the Air Force. Religious accommodation requests are handled on a case-by-case basis at each assignment throughout the Airman's career. As such, a religious accommodation may be granted at one assignment but denied at another assignment. Every request will be fully considered by the appropriate authority; however, if the request is denied the Airman will be required to comply with Air Force standards. Following the briefing, the applicant's acknowledgment of the Air Force policy regarding religious accommodation requests will be recorded and maintained as part of the accession application.
