In these cases, credit will be limited to the amount required for appointment in these grades.

Count constructive service credit listed in [Table 2.4](#table2_4), [Table 2.5](#table2_5), and [Table 2.6](#table2_6) for education or professional training. When education or training overlaps other creditable service, count the constructive service first, then reduce the other creditable service for any overlapping period.
