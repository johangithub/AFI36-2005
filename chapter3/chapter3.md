####[3.8.](#3_8){#3_8} Designation To Perform Professional Functions as a Chaplain, Judge Advocate, or Medical Service Officer.

To apply, an officer submits a memorandum application and attaches documents not already included in the Master Personnel Record Group (MPerRGp). EXAMPLE: Diploma from medical school, transcript of college work, copy of license to practice, and any other documents or information the officer desires to submit. 

######[3.8.1.](#3_8_1){#3_8_1} Accept a certificate of physical fitness instead of a medical examination, if the officer has complied with the requirements for a periodic physical examination. However, an officer who has not submitted a report of medical examination within 3 years before the date of application must submit a current examination. 

######[3.8.2.](#3_8_2){#3_8_2} The appointing authority reappoints officers of the MSC who are medical or dental students as first lieutenants when the students meet the requirements outlined in Chapter 6. (See Table 2.1,  note 6, for authority to reappoint medical students as captains.) 

######[3.8.3.](#3_8_3){#3_8_3} The appointing authority may withdraw designation to perform professional functions and assign an officer to the LAF if:

+ 3.8.3.2. HQ USAF/SG, HQ USAF/JAX, or HQ USAF/HC, as appropriate, does not object to such reappointment or transfer.

+ 3.8.3.3. A requirement exists in a line specialty for which the officer qualifies and can be effectively utilized.

######[3.8.4.](#3_8_4){#3_8_4} When the action does not involve the award of service credit and a change in grade or DOR does not occur, the appropriate appointing authority designates the officer to perform professional functions or withdraws such designation by administrative order.

The applicant should sign and date the written advisory. 

######[3.8.6.](#3_8_6){#3_8_6} When a line officer on flying status with a current effective aeronautical rating accepts reappointment in the medical service, or as a chaplain, or judge advocate, the appropriate office (AFI 11-402) publishes an order disqualifying the officer from flying status. 

---
####[3.9.](#3_9){#3_9} Validity of Oaths of Office and Acceptances.

######[3.9.1.](#3_9_1){#3_9_1} Each individual must take and subscribe to an oath of office according to AFI 36-2006, Oath of Office (Military Personnel) and Certificate of Commission before entering the duties of the office. The appointing authority cancels the appointment if the individual will not execute the oath of office without modifications or reservations. In situations described in 3.9.2 and 3.9.3, when an officer establishes acceptance by another means, the officer must submit a properly executed oath of office as a prerequisite for entitlement to full pay and allowances. 

######[3.9.2.](#3_9_2){#3_9_2} Executing and returning the oath of office constitutes a formal acceptance of appointment. (Acceptance is "expressed," as by formal acceptance in writing, or "implied," as by performance of the duties of the office pursuant to an order of competent authority or an obligated Regular officer who accepts a discharge from active duty, contingent upon acceptance of a Reserve appointment.)

+ 3.9.2.1. If an appointee enters on AD or into active status before executing the oath of office, the appointing authority records the date of entry on AD or into active status, as applicable, as the implied or constructive date of acceptance. However, the appointing authority must obtain an executed oath of office as soon as possible.

+ 3.9.2.2. The officer executes the oath as of the current date. On receiving the oath from the officer, the appointing authority annotates it as follows: Date of entry (on active duty or into active status, as applicable) on (date) pursuant to Special Order (#) HQ (Issuing), dated (of order), constitutes constructive acceptance of appointment. Acceptance officially recorded as of date of EAD or entry into active status, as applicable. 

######[3.9.3.](#3_9_3){#3_9_3} An oath of office properly dated and signed by an appointee, but administered by other than an authorized official is not a valid oath, but it is effective as an acceptance and recorded as such. In such cases, the appointing authority: 

+ 3.9.3.1. Obtains a valid oath of office dated as the date actually executed.

+ 3.9.3.2. Forwards both oaths with the application and appointment documents to the proper MPerRGp custodian. 

######[3.9.4.](#3_9_4){#3_9_4} When an individual who is in training to qualify for later reappointment executes the oath of office on a date after he or she completes educational requirements, the appointing authority annotates the oath as follows: Date of appointment recorded for record purposes as the completion date of educational requirements.
