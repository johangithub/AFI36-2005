<p>2.4.1. An officer who submits an unqualified resignation following a period of honorable service and who has a remaining Military Service Obligation (MSO) or unfulfilled contractual agreement, is discharged if he or she accepts a Reserve appointment in the grade held in the RegAF at the time of discharge. HQ ARPC/DAO initially transfers an officer with a remaining MSO to the Ready Reserve and assigns the officer to the ORS, ARPC, unless they applied for a Ready Reserve participating assignment. </p>
<p>2.4.2. An officer, who has no MSO or unfulfilled contractual agreement and who is honorably discharged by reason of unqualified resignation, may request appointment as a ResAF officer at the time of resignation. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>2.4.2.1. The unit commander must submit a memorandum of recommendation or non-recommendation, which will accompany the request. For non-recommendation, the commander specifies the reasons and gives the officer a copy. The commander also promptly notifies HQ ARPC/DAO and the servicing military personnel flight (MPF), if, after submitting a recommendation for Reserve appointment, the recommendation changes. Approval for ResAF appointment may be withdrawn if it is determined that the appointment would not be in the best interest of the Air Force. </p>
</li>
<li><p>2.4.2.2. Since accepting a Reserve commission constitutes voluntary assignment to the Ready Reserve (IRR or Selected), HQ ARPC/DAO transfers officers appointed under paragraph 2.4.2 to the Ready Reserve and assigns them to the Nonobligated Nonparticipating Ready Personnel Section (NNRPS), unless they applied for a Ready Reserve participating assignment. </p>
</li>
<li><p>2.4.2.3. The officer accepts the ResAF appointment, by memorandum, and completes the oath of office as a Reserve officer on the day after discharge to ensure continuous commissioned status. The oath of office must be executed and returned to HQ ARPC/DAO within 15 calendar days of discharge or the Reserve appointment is canceled. To decline a Reserve appointment, applicants must so state in writing to HQ ARPC/DAO within 15 calendar days of discharge, with the reasons for declination. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2.4.3. An officer who resigns to enter seminary training is not eligible for appointment as a ResAF officer. Under law, an individual preparing for the ministry in a recognized theological or divinity school may not be required to serve on AD or participate in active duty training or service, active duty for training (ADT), or inactive duty training (IDT). However, the officer may apply for appointment as a chaplain or chaplain candidate after meeting the requirements specified in Chapter 5. </p>
<p>2.4.4. An officer who does not request a ResAF appointment upon resignation, or who originally declined a Reserve appointment, may ask HQ ARPC/DAO for Reserve appointment consideration up to 12 months after discharge. </p>
<p>2.4.5. In addition to other requirements, a former chaplain submits a current DD Form 2088, Statement of Ecclesiastical Endorsement, for appointment as a ResAF.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>See paragraph 2.3.2 for waiver.</li>
<li>Air Force policy requires that individuals appointed in the grade of second lieutenant to fill active force requirements in the LAF and medical service and individuals appointed in the grade of first lieutenant to fill active force requirements as judge advocates must be appointed and enter EAD before reaching age 35. Officers serving in NC or BSC must be able to complete 20 years active federal military service to include 10 years active federal commissioned service by the end of the month of the officer&apos;s 62nd birthday. Therefore, individuals appointed in NC or BSC to fill active force requirements must enter EAD before reaching age 42 years. This policy was signed 29 July 1994 and is retroactive to 1 October 1993. (EXCEPTION: Health professionals in specialties designated by HQUSAF/SG as specialties critically needed in wartime do not have to meet eligibility requirements for RegAF commission to enter EAD.)</li>
<li>Maximum age for initial appointment in a health professional specialty designated by AF/SG as a specialty critically needed in wartime is 47 years. Submit exceptions to policy through channels to AF/A1P, AF/RE, or NGB/A1 as appropriate.</li>
<li>Maximum age for chaplain candidates is less than 35 years. EXCEPTION: Maximum age, with waiver, for chaplain candidates is 42 years old. Waiver authority is SAF/MR.</li>
<li>Maximum age for chaplains is less than 40 years or less than 42 years with 2 years satisfactory prior service. Waivers that exceed maximum age by more than 3-years and do not exceed 47 years of age require SAF/MR approval. Appointment beyond age 47 requires SAF/MR approval of Exceptional To Policy (ETP).</li>
<li>Reserve Medical Corps (MC) and Dental Corps (DC) officers may be originally appointed in the grade of captain with 4 years of credit (<a href="#table2_4">Table 2.4</a>., rule 1) upon completing medical school. This provision began 1 October 1983.</li>
<li>For appointment in this grade, see paragraph 2.18.2.</li>
<li>For Nurse Corps (NC), Biomedical Sciences Corps (BSC) and Medical Service Corps (MSC) officers appointed for the sole purpose of entering Extended Active Duty(EAD), service credit awarded must be at least 14 years.</li>
